# Learning Ansible Playbooks :monkey:
- This is a simple boot of 1 instance using vagrant and provisioning the instance using ansible playbooks to install and configure nginx.
- This repo is for me to learn how to use ansible playbooks with vagrant. Commands are being run on vagrant rather than ansible due to ansible being hardcoded into the vagrantfile.
